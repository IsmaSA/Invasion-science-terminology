## Abstract
Standardised use of terminology in science is important for clarity in interpretation and communication of phenomena. In invasion science, a consistent and clearly stated use of terminology is required for effective communication across researchers, stakeholders, and policymakers, especially where the outcomes of fundamental research translate into impact metrics and management. However, convoluted and inconsistent usage of terminology with various discrepancies in descriptions of damages and interventions have predominated in invasion science. These inconsistencies stem from the exponential increase in scientific publications on biological invasions authored by both invasion specialists and experts from various other disciplines. Therefore, aligning consensus in the terminology remains a prevailing challenge in invasion science. Here, we evaluate the multiple terms used in invasion science (e.g. 'established', 'non-native', 'alien', 'invasive', 'exotic', 'non-indigenous', 'naturalized') to propose a new, simplified, and standardised terminology to be used in the field going forward. The streamlined framework we propose is based on the terms (i) 'non-native species', denoting species transported beyond their natural biogeographic range, (ii) 'established non-native species', i.e. those that have succeeded in creating self-sustaining populations without human assistance in their new location(s), and (iii) 'invasive species' — those established, non-native species that have spread or are spreading in their invaded range. In addition, we highlight the importance of conceptualising 'spread' for invasiveness classification and 'impact' for management. Finally, we propose a protocol for classifying species populations based on (1) movement mechanism, (2) origin, (3) status, and (4) impact. Collectively, and without introducing new terminology, the framework we present aims to facilitate effective communication, collaboration, and management of non-native species.
